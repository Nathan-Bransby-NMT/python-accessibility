# The Checklist

<samp>

## Planning Phase

  ### Venue Selection
  
  - [ ] Confirm that the entire venue has step-free access, including the speaking stage.
  - [ ] Verify wheelchair accessible bathrooms with grab-bars, lowered toilets, and lowered sinks.
  - [ ] Ensure gender-neutral bathrooms are available.
  - [ ] Check and document whether step-free access doors and lifts can be used independently.
  - [ ] Make sure paths remain wide enough for people with mobility aids.
  - [ ] Document specific details about mobility accommodations (not just "wheelchair accessible").
  - [ ] Verify service animals are welcome and identify quiet, shaded grassy areas for them.
  - [ ] Check accessibility of social event and dinner venues (often more problematic for accessibility than main venues).
  - [ ] Consider venue layout is wide and not ristrictive, to prevent bottlenecks and overcrowding risks.
  - [ ] Ensure conference rooms are on the same level when possible.
  - [ ] Position essential facilities (speaker preparation rooms, parenting room) close to elevators.
  - [ ] Select venues with accessible stages as a non-negotiable requirement.
  - [ ] Consider capacity limits that still allow for comfertable movement to prevent over-crowding and health concerns.
  - [ ] A quiet "chill-out" space for people who may feel overwhelmed, over-stimulated, or anxious — _consider providing options for live-streaming talks, so they don't miss out._

  ### Communication & Website
  
  - [ ] Create and publish an accessibility statement early (before early bird pricing and CFP closes).
  - [ ] Run website through accessibility checker and address issues promptly.
  - [ ] Request or allow accessibility reviews of your website from the community and experts.
  - [ ] Provide clear contact information for accessibility inquiries (email is often most accessible). And consider having a director/manager be responsible for the communication between the event and attendees, checking emails frequently.
  - [ ] Include photos of venue access routes and floor plans in accessibility documentation.
  - [ ] Post detailed accessibility information on website, including:
    - [ ] Step-free access route and details.
    - [ ] Bathroom accessibility.
    - [ ] Services such providing streaming of the event with livecaptions or OCR descriptors, for attendees who are hard of hearing, low-vision.
    - [ ] Child care availability.
    - [ ] Recovery group information.
    - [ ] Dietary accomodation capabilities
  - [ ] Create a culture page explaining community norms and in-jokes to help newcomers feel included.
  - [ ] Communicate COVID-19/Health policies clearly (if applicable).
  - [ ] Create a mission statement that explicitly mentions inclusivity goals.
  
  ### Financial Accessibility
  
  - [ ] Try and keep ticket prices as low as possible.
  - [ ] Schedule the event on a weekend to make it accessible for those who can't take time off work.
  - [ ] Offer a student/diversity rate for registration.
  - [ ] If available to you, implement a financial assistance scheme to help delegate who couldn't otherwise afford to attend.
  - [ ] Reach out to sponsors to organise possible grant funding for people needing to pay for travel to and from the event.
  - [ ] If tickets tend to sell out fast, consider releasing them in stages. A novel idea to remain inclusive could be selling the final round of tickets as a lottery system, as apposed to a "first-come-first-served" sale.
  
  ### Registration Process
  
  - [ ] Ask about accessibility needs during the registration process, to try and accomodate in advance for your atendees.
  - [ ] Ask about dietary restrictions/preferences during registration.
  - [ ] If providing t-shirts, ask for size preferences during registration.
  - [ ] Avoid asking for first and last name separately — instead ask for their prefered name and only ask for a legal name when required.
  - [ ] Ensure registration forms allow for non-binary gender options with free text fields (if gender is required).
  - [ ] Implement a "diversity and inclusions awareness form" to understand community needs.
  
  ### Call for Proposals (CFP) & Selection Process
  
  - [ ] Publish Code of Conduct and health policy before sending out CFP.
  - [ ] Be clear about what's included in the speaker package.
  - [ ] Send CFP to diversity-focused Python groups & communities that encourage diversity in tech (gender, disability, LGBTQIA+, cultural diversity, socio-economic inclusivity, regional/remote communities, age-barriers, veterans, etc.)
    
    > Global inclusive Python communities, such as:
    > - [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/locations/) (local and global)
    > - [Django Girls+](https://djangogirls.org/en/events/)
    > - [Black Python Devs](https://blackpythondevs.com/)
    > - [PyVersify](https://github.com/PyVersify) <!--https://pyversify.github.io)--> `comming soon`
    > - Other local or global diversity groups.
  
  - [ ] Contact universities/tertiary-education Facilities — encourage first-time presenters and educators the opportunity to present.
  - [ ] Offer mentor sessions for less experienced speakers.
  - [ ] Reach out to local Python User Groups
  - [ ] Consider language accessibility by encouraging non-English contributions.
  - [ ] Split proposal submissions up into different cattegories to ensure a diverse range of talks, (software, networking, IoT, science, community, etc.) 
  - [ ] Implement a democratic agenda selection process that gives the community a voice.
  - [ ] Allow submissions on any software industry-related topic to encourage diverse perspectives.
  - [ ] Actively work to create opportunities for underrepresented groups, young people, and first-time speakers.
  - [ ] Create an accessibility requirement for any presentations or conference material proposed.

## Preparation Phase

  ### Accessibility Services
  
  - [ ] Implement [Assistive Technology & Tools](https://github.com/Nathan-Bransby-NMT/python-accessibility/tree/main#i-assistive-technologies-and-tools) into your event infrastructure.
  - [ ] Consider having a live transcriptions or a captioner/stenographer (helps people with hearing issues and non-native speakers).
  - [ ] Consider offering childcare (onsite or covering costs at home).
  - [ ] Prepare a quiet room for people who may feel overwhelmed (ensure it's easily accessible and has appropriate lighting).
  - [ ] Consider budgeting for an Accredited Access Consultant for technical accessibility advice.
  - [ ] Establish an Access and Inclusion Advisory Group consisting of people passionate about universal access

  ### Diversity Initiatives
  
  - [ ] Appoint a dedicated diversity team to focus efforts across multiple dimensions (gender, seniority, ethnicity, accessibility, and role).
  - [ ] Create clear, consistent signage with good color contrast.
  - [ ] Test signage and materials with tools like Color Oracle for color perception issues
  - [ ] Prepare pronoun buttons/stickers (He/Him/His, She/Her/Hers, They/Them/Theirs, blank options)
  - [ ] Consider different lanyard colors to indicate photo/recording preferences
  - [ ] Prepare bathroom supplies and basic necessities for attendees (tissues, tampons, pads, deodorant, toothbrushes)
  - [ ] Create a glossary of community terms to help first-timers feel included
  - [ ] Offer communication preference indicators such as coloured name-tag lanyards that allows for atendees to change their preference during the event:
    - `Green Tag`: Happy to chat with anyone.
    - `Yellow Tag`: Happy to chat but please check first.
    - `Red Tag`: I'll approach you if I want to chat.

  ### Code of Conduct (CoC)
  
  - [ ] Establish a dedicated CoC team (ideally around four people).
  - [ ] Make CoC team members known and listed by name on the website.
  - [ ] Set up dedicated reporting channels (email, phone numbers).
  - [ ] Plan to monitor chat/social media for potential CoC issues.
  - [ ] Consider screening presenters' slides in advance for CoC violations and accessibility issues.
  - [ ] Establish clear community norms:
    - No trash-talking other programming communities or languages.
    - Don't assume people aren't technical.
    - Avoid making jokes at the expense of others ("punching down").
    - Encourage the phrase "we don't do that here" when problematic behavior occurs.
    
  - [ ] Require explicit agreement to the Code of Conduct from all speakers during the securing process.
  - [ ] Prepare staff by discussing potential scenarios including the possibility of expelling attendees.
  - [ ] Ensure all volunteers know exactly what to do and who to contact if Code of Conduct issues arise.

  - [ ] Implement crowd management strategies to prevent bottlenecks
  - [ ] Create an incident reporting system

## During the Event

  ### Registration & Welcome

  - [ ] Have organizers visibly available at registration desk.
  - [ ] Ensure badges have names printed large enough to read from a distance.
  - [ ] Print badges double-sided as they tend to flip around.
  - [ ] Have extra blank badges and materials available for on-the-spot corrections.
  - [ ] Make attendees feel welcome with positive messaging and clear information.
  - [ ] Consider implementing a mask policy to make the event accessible to more people.

  ### Presentations & Speakers

## Post-Event Considerations

  ### Recordings & Media
  
  - [ ] Ensure permission from speakers before recording/publishing their talks.
  - [ ] Check photos and videos for anyone with a no-photo lanyard before publishing.
  - [ ] Moderate or disable comments on uploaded videos to prevent harassment.
  - [ ] Review contracts with photographers/videographers regarding intellectual property.

  ### Follow-up
  
  - [ ] Consider publishing a CoC transparency report (ensuring nobody is identifiable).
  - [ ] Ensure that thanks and appreciation is communicated effectively to volunteers for their contributions.
  - [ ] Gather feedback on accessibility and inclusion measures for future improvement.
  - [ ] Measure the effectiveness of communication channels using indicators like engagement rates.
        
  ### Environmental Considerations

  - [ ] Announce alternatives to flying early (to reduce carbon emissions).
  - [ ] Provide information about local green transportation options.
  - [ ] Consider waste reduction measures (reusable containers, water fountains).
  - [ ] Make merchandise optional or pre-ordered to reduce waste.
  - [ ] Source merch for ethically sustainable manufactures.
  - [ ] Don't sacrifice accessibility for environmental measures.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that this checklist is not exhaustive, and you may not be able to implement every suggestion. The goal is to make your event as accessible and inclusive as possible within your constraints.
